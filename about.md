<p>
	Hi! My name is Andrey, and I'm a Software Engineer. I enjoy running, climbing, playing music, photography, 
	and doing martial arts. I really like exploring new music and films, as well as unusual foods. 
	Currently, I work in American Express where I am a fullstack developer on the OPEN team, which 
	specializes in the small business credit card journey.
</p>
<p>
	I enjoy building systems that rely on performance and require high levels of efficiency, and thats why my 
	<a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/bachelors/computer-science/threads">
	threads</a> (fancy name for concentrations) at GT were System Architecture and AI when I graduated from 
	in Dec 2019. I enjoy working on my own projects, competing in hackathons, and learning new things.
</p>
<p>
	I help run a non-profit with my family called <a href="http://sigmacamp.org/">SigmaCamp</a>,
	which lets highschool experience high level of hands-on STEM with some of the smartest people
	in the world, including Fields Medalist and Ivy League professors.
</p>
<p>
	Recently, I've joined the 
	<a href="https://greenpointchurch.org/hunger-program/">Greenpoint Reformed Church Hunger Program</a>, 
	where I help with running the weekly food pantry and soup kitchen.
