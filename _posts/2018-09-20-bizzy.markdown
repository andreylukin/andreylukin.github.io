**Summary** 

Bizzy is a study group making app that allows college students to create physical study groups based on their geographic location and their subject. 

* Accepted into Idea to Prototype: Create-X selective program at GT to launch an app in Fall 2018 on campus
* Lead a team on creating an app called Bizzy that helps students create real-time physical study groups on- campus using React Native and Firebase

**Inspiration**

"Don't push your homework to public Github repos, this will go against school policy and you'll receive a zero. You're basically enabling cheating!" As CS majors who have large group projects, it is hard for people to manage version control. Even though large schools like Georgia Tech and UPenn offer private repos, not all college students are fortunate enough to have that luxury. What should a student do in this situation, to still get a private repo, but also be able to use the cool tool provided by GitHub on the website?

**What it does**

Gitcognito is a combination of a command line tool and a chrome extension. Using the command line tool, you set your own encrypting password, and then just start using git as usual. Whenever you push to GitHub, the files, file names, and even commit messages will show up as encrypted gibberish, unreadable for the normal eye. This is why we also have a Chrome extension, which allows anyone with the password to view the code online like its normal code. The only difference for the user is running `gcn <command>` instead of `git <command>`.
