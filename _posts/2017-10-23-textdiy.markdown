**Summary** 

Competed in the Home Depot Hackathon on Oct 2017 in Midtown Atlanta. Won 2nd place overall.

* Created an SMS chatbot that presents the user with DIY project inspirations, and the tools and the materials necessary to make them
* Built a web crawler to collect building tutorials for hundreds of projects
* Hosted the project on a DigitalOcean droplet, and had the backend running with Twilio, Flask, and PostgreSQL

This was a DIY chatbot for the THD codeathlon! The purpose of this chatbot is to provide DIY projects to the masses. It's meant to be able to reach a big audience as possible because 25% of the American population doesn't have a smartphone. It's also meant to be convenient as it doesn't require Wi-Fi and doesn't take up much of your phone's processing power.

Text 202-TEXTDIY to start chatting! 

P.S. Might have cut the phone number to save money.
